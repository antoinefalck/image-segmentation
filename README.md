Image Segmentation

The algorithms I implemented in *MATLAB*, for the segmentation using the Markov chain approach. The final step is to segment a picture on which we added noise.

If you want more details, especially on the theory that is behind the algorithms, don't hesitate to contact me. I've made two reports on the subjects, simply ask me if you want to read them.
